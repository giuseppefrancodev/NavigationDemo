# Navigation Demo App

## Overview

This Android application demonstrates a sophisticated navigation system built with a focus on performance, reliability, and cross-platform potential. The app combines native C++ code for performance-critical navigation functions with a modern Android UI built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Technical Achievements

### Hybrid Architecture

- **C++ Navigation Core**: Performance-critical components like routing algorithms, map matching, and location filtering are implemented in C++
- **JNI Bridge**: Custom Java Native Interface implementation to seamlessly connect Kotlin and C++
- **Kotlin UI Layer**: Modern UI built with Jetpack Compose following Material 3 design principles

### Navigation Features

- **OpenStreetMap Integration**: Parses and utilizes real OSM data for navigation
- **Location Filtering**: Implements a custom Kalman filter to smooth GPS data
- **A* Routing Algorithm**: Efficient pathfinding with multiple routing strategies (fastest, no highways)
- **Route Matching**: Matches user position to the closest point on a route
- **Alternative Routes**: Generates and displays multiple route options
- **Turn-by-Turn Directions**: Provides real-time navigation instructions
- **Simulation Mode**: Allows testing navigation without physically moving

### Engineering Excellence

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with repository pattern and dependency injection
- **Reactive Design**: Leverages Kotlin StateFlow for UI state management
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage of view models and repositories
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Hilt for clean, testable component management
- **Modern Kotlin**: Utilizes coroutines, flows, and other modern Kotlin features

### Performance Optimizations

- **Native Code**: Critical algorithms implemented in C++ for maximum performance
- **Spatial Indexing**: Custom spatial indexing for efficient geographic queries
- **Memory Management**: Careful memory handling in C++ with RAII patterns

## Future Enhancements

The app has been designed with future improvements in mind:

- **Cross-Platform Potential**: The C++ core can be shared with iOS in the future
- **External Library Integration**: Ready for integration with libraries like:
  - Mapbox Navigation SDK
  - Valhalla Routing Engine
  - GeographicLib
  - OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)

## Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Kotlin, C++17
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose, Material 3
- **Maps**: Google Maps Compose
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Concurrency**: Kotlin Coroutines
- **Native Code**: Android NDK, JNI
- **Build System**: Gradle, CMake
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito
